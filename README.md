# WEB102 Prework - Jacqueline's Web102 Prework

Submitted by: Jacqueline Zamitalo

Jacqueline's Web102 Prework is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 3.5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [Y] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [Y] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [Y] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [Y] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [Y] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Implemented an "Our Games" navigation link in the header which allows the web viewer to jump immediately to the section with the list of games
- Changed some of the CSS of the background section and of the section titles to make the website look a bit cleaner, at least in my opinion.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

    Two of the biggest challenges I faced while working on this project were with destructuring and troubleshooting. I had a fair amount of exposure to most of the topics covered in this project before I started it, with the main exceptions being some of the JS topics including destructuring. I found destructuring harder to conceptually understand and execute than other new topics I had no experience with, like spreading. Even in my current code, I am not completely sure that I've implemented it correctly. I followed the example given in the destructuring explanation. I decided to program what I thought was correct, and then work around any incorrect functionality using spreading, since we were instructed to use both.

    I also struggled a bit with troubleshooting in the beginning. When I was adding the games to the page, I employed a "code-everything and test after" strategy, because I wasn't sure how to test it while implementing it. I usually try to avoid this strategy, because I find it harder to fix a lot of code that doesn't work for possibly many reasons than to fix a small piece of code that doesn't work for one or two reasons.
